# GPT-from-scratch
Goal is to implement a GPT architecture from scratch

To do list:
- [x] bigram
- [ ] embedding
- [ ] positional encoding
- [ ] self attention
- [ ] multi head attention
- [ ] feed forward network
- [ ] skip connection
- [ ] layer normalisation
- [ ] blocks
- [ ] dropout
- [ ] complete pipeline
- [ ] write blogs and add appropriate documentation 


PS:
I have used chatgpt to generate docstrings for all the functions to make it more clear :))
